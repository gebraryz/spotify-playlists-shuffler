      "question": "Will changes made during the mixing of the playlist be saved if I leave the page during the process?",

    },
    "spotify_generated_playlists": {
      "question": "Why can't I mix playlists generated by Spotify?",
      "answer": "Some playlists created by Spotify can be modified, and others cannot. Unfortunately, there is no way to determine which playlists can be altered, so the application only displays playlists created by the user."
